# Introduction
In the first year of my Computer Science degree, I completed a module on databases where I was tasked to design and implement a working database for a fictional employment agency using command line SQL and phpMyAdmin.

## Requirements
The database should mirror **Selected Aspects** of a commercial employment agency such as:
- Helping job seekers find suitable employment opportunites
- Assisting employers in finding qualified candidates to meet their staffing needs

## Features
- A python script to connect and send commands to the database
  - This will not work for public users as it needs to be run on a specific network.
- 12 Normalised Entities
- 5 Unique Views
- An Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram
- A Data Dictionary

## Database Screenshots
Below you can find screenshots of a few of the tables featured in this database.
